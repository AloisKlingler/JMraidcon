JMraidcon, very much a work in progress.

Attempts to communicate with the JMB394 / JMS56x SATA HW RAID controller
to request disk and RAID volume health status, instead of having
to run the enormous X-based HWRaidManager binary.

Currently the communication is working, but using a hard-coded
sector number, hard-coded commands and no parsing of the responses,
but it can clearly be seen that the disks are properly identified
from the hex/ASCII output.

added most important decoding of data from https://github.com/timschuerewegen/jmraid
